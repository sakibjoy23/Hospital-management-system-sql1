Patients: (PatientID, Name, Age, Gender, Phone.)

Appointments (AppointmentID, Date, Time, Status.)

Departments: (DepartmentID, Name, and Location.)

Diagram Submission:

Draw an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the relationships between tables, primary keys, and foreign keys. Submit a clear image of the diagram.

SQL Queries:

- Write SQL queries to create the above tables, including PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints.

- Add at least 5 dummy records for each table.

Submission Guidelines:

- Submit a clear image of the ER diagram.

- Submit SQL queries in a text file. (Create table and insert 5 data per table)

- Combine the files into a zip file and submit. You can also submit GitHub repo link.
